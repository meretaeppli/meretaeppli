  												<h3 class="major">Energetic limitations on carbon turnover in floodplain soils</h3>
  												
											
											<p>
Floodplains are active sites of carbon turnover, yet important knowledge gaps exist regarding the oxidation of organic carbon to carbon dioxide in microbial respiration.
Energetic yields of microbial respiration in oxygen-depleted environments are low and limit rates of anaerobic microbial respiration, resulting in the thermodynamic preservation of organic carbon.
It is unclear if carbon is thermodynamically preserved when minerals are used as electron acceptors in microbial respiration.
This project aims at determining if the low reactivity of minerals contributes to carbon stabilization in floodplain soils.
I work with floodplain soils from the East and Slate rivers, both located near Crested Butte in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado.

  												<h3 class="major">Biogeochemistry of Lake Tahoe sediments</h3>
  												
											
											<p>
Lake Tahoe is a deep lake with mostly nutrient-free water located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range at the border between California and Nevada.
The sediments of Lake Tahoe contain large amounts of ferric iron minerals.
These minerals are at risk to be reductively dissolved as oxygen supply to the sediments decreases due to increased lake stratification in a warmer climate..
Reductive dissolution of iron minerals releases ferrous iron as well as nutrients that are associated with the minerals into the water column, impacting lake water quality.
I am collaborating with researchers at the <a href="https://tahoe.ucdavis.edu/research" <span>Tahoe Environmental Research Center</span></a> to determine which biogeochemical processes are active in the lake sediments today and how these will change in the future.

  												<h3 class="major">Biogeochemical and transport processes in alluvial groundwater systems</h3>
  												
											
											<p> 
Groundwater quality in alluvial systems is controlled by biogeochemical and transport processes.
The <a href="https://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/sfa/groundwater-quality-sfa-research-program" <span>Scientific Focus Area: Groundwater Quality</span></a> project addresses the question of how these processes couple to one-another and control groundwater quality under hydrologically variable conditions.
An interdisciplinary team of environmental microbiologists, modelers, geochemists, and biogeochemists collaborates on this project.
My role is to investigate the molecular mechanisms, rates, and products of exchange across interfaces between anoxic and oxic zones in sediments.

									<p>
Ferric iron oxides are redox-active minerals that are widespread in nature.
Electron transfer to ferric iron is a key step in many biogeochemical processes that control the cycling of nutrients and trace elements, as well as the dynamics of organic and inorganic pollutants.
My doctoral research aimed at improving our understanding of this electron transfer reaction by developing experimental approaches and conceptual frameworks.

  												<h3 class="major">Development of electrochemical approach to quantify electron transfer to iron oxides</h3>
  												
											
											<p>
I used a mediated electrochemical approach to characterize the electron accepting properties of ferric iron oxides, including ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite.
This approach allows quantifying rates and extents of electron transfer at constant applied reduction potential and constant pH.
The thermodynamics of electron transfer to the iron oxides is determined by the mineralogy of the oxide, the applied reduction potential, and pH.
By conducting electrochemical measurements on different oxides at varying applied reduction potential and pH, I succeeded in rates of electron transfer to iron oxides to the thermodynamics of the electron transfer reaction.
Describing electron transfer to ferric iron on the basis of thermodynamics allows us to directly compare redox reactivities among iron oxides and solution conditions.

  												<h3 class="major">Changes in the redox reactivity of iron oxides during oxide transformations</h3>
  												
											
											<p>
Amorphous iron oxides, like ferrihydrite, transform into thermodynamically more stable iron oxides over time.
Using mediated electrochemistry, I showed that the transformation of ferrihydrite into goethite and magnetite is accompanied by a decrease in the reactivity of the iron oxide toward accepting electrons.
Quantitative information on the decrease in oxide reactivity during ferrihydrite transformation is key to estimating how transformation affects redox reactions involving iron oxides, such as the microbial reduction of iron oxides.

  												<h3 class="major">Decreasing redox reactivity of iron oxides during microbial reduction of oxides</h3>
  												
											
											<p>
Iron-reducing microorganisms transfer electrons to ferric iron during anaerobic respiration.
This process produces ferrous iron that induces transformation of the iron oxides into thermodynamically more stable phases.
As a consequence, the energetic yield of electron transfer to ferric iron decreases over the course of the transformation and may ultimately limit microbial respiration.
In incubations with the iron-reducing bacterium <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> and ferrihydrite, I showed that the redox reactivity of the iron oxide decreased as ferrihydrite transformed into goethite and magnetite.
The cessation of microbial respiration in the incubations coincided with a drop in redox reactivity due to magnetite formation, suggesting that microbial respiration rates were limited by the redox reactivity of ferric iron.
This work was published as <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b01299" <span><i>Decreases in Iron Oxide Reducibility during Microbial Reductive Dissolution and Transformation of Ferrihydrite</i></span></a>.</p>

  												<h3 class="major">Reduction of ferric iron oxides by electron transfer shuttles</h3>
  												
											
											<p>
Ferric iron exists in the form of minerals in the environment and iron-reducing microorganisms therefore face the challenge of transferring electrons to solid phases.
To overcome this challenge, microorganisms use organic molecules to shuttle electrons from the microbial cells to the mineral surfaces.
Using such electron shuttles enhances microbial respiration rates to ferric iron.
However, microbial respiration rates vary considerably among organisms, electron shuttles, and iron minerals and it remains unknown which properties of extracellular electron shuttles are responsible for stimulating microbial metabolism.
In this work, I present a thermodynamic approach to elucidate these properties.
